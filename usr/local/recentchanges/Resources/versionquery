If having problems with keys.
1. Try to delete the all .gpg to make new ones. 2. Failing that do the same as 1 but change email in config.toml to make a new keypair

or option 3.
delete the keys for user and root
gpg --list-keys . grab the key fingerprint for the email in config.toml.
as user gpg --delete-sercet-keys <fingerprint>
gpg --delete-keys <fingerprint>
then as root. sudo su
gpg --delete-sercret-keys <fingerprint>
gpg --delete-keys <fingerprint>

failing that use `recentchanges reset` for instructions and or to delete the key pair and reset
